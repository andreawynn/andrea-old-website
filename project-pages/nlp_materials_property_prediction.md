### My Contributions
For this project, I did the following:
- Processed the entire C4 dataset (~400 GB) to include spaces between each number and any other characters surrounding it.
- Fine tuned a tokenizer on the new dataset, to better parse numerical information. 
- Trained and evaluated a BERT-style model as a benchmark, and ran ablation studies.
