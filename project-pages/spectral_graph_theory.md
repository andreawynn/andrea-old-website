## Spectral Touching Points in 2-Dimensional Materials
### Independent Research Project (Advisor: Dr. Tracy Weyand)
*August 2020 - August 2021*

### Motivation for Research
In recent years, graphene has gained significant popularity as a building material and energy storage medium with a wide variety of applications. One of grapheneâ€™s most unique properties is its conductivity, which is enhanced by mass-less fermions that enable loss-less electron transfer across a graphene sheet. 

Previous researchers (Novoselov, 2011) have conjectured a potential relation between a special type of spectral touching point, Dirac conical points, and the unique properties of graphene, although this has yet to be formally proven. Further research from T. Weyand (2014) and R. Martin (2017) found that variations of graphene also have these touching points. 

The goal of my research was to search for other materials possessing Dirac conical points, which may indicate the presence of properties similar to those of graphene. Since graphene is the only material which has been studied in this context before, my goal was to study a wider variety of structures and to set a precedent for further investigation into the relationship between spectral touching points and the physical properties of materials. 

### Findings
Some of my most significant findings include finding over 10 different materials with the same mathematical properties as graphene (i.e. Dirac conical touching points for all values of electric potential), as well as investigating a number of new materials such as Quartz, Sodium Chloride, and Transition Metal Oxides which all have fundamentally different atomic structures that have not yet been studied in this field. 

I discovered Dirac conical touching points in quartz for certain values of electric potential, and I also discovered another type of spectral touching point (flat sheet touching point) in Sodium Chloride. Additionally, I discovered and proved the existence of a completely new type of spectral touching point that occurs for certain values of electric potential in Transition Metal Oxides, which I named the mesa touching point due to its resemblance to the flat-topped hills for which it was named.

## Presentations & Awards
I presented this research at the <a href="https://www.math.unl.edu/~ncuwm/23rdAnnual/">23rd Annual Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics</a> (NCUWM), which was held virtually on January 22-24, 2021. The full recording of my presentation can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEHXWofqRZY&feature=youtu.be">here</a>, starting at roughly the 16 minute mark. 

I presented this work again at the Rose-Hulman Undergraduate Mathematics Conference and the Rose Show, both in 2021. My presentation at the Rose Show won the Departmental Award for best presentation out of all presenters, including all senior theses in the department. 

Additionally, I was awarded the highly selective Henry Turner Eddy Award for Applications of Mathematics for my work on this research project. This is an award given annually by the Rose-Hulman faculty to a student who has demonstrated exceptional potential for conducting research in applied mathematics, in addition to strong performance in coursework and involvement with the mathematics department. 

### Future Opportunities for Further Research
In the future, it would be interesting to continue investigating some additional questions related to this work, including generalizing some of the results found through my work. For example, the following questions may prompt further study in this field:

- For what materials, and for what values of electric potential, are there touching points where $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are both nonzero?
- What aspect of transition metal oxides' infinite periodic graph representation or atomic structure caused the occurrence of mesa touching points?
- Are there any other materials which have mesa touching points under certain conditions?
- Under what symmetry conditions on the electric potential values $q_i$ of the fundamental domain do spectral touching points occur for transition metal oxides and quartz?

It would also be interesting to study the physical properties of other materials with spectral touching points and see whether there exists any relationship with physical properties similar to those of graphene. Quartz and muscovite would be especially interesting to study, since those have a distinct physical structure from graphene but still have Dirac conical touching points, at least under certain conditions. It would also be interesting to investigate potential implications of mesa touching points for physical material properties, and to see whether these touching points occur in other materials as well.

### Tools and Methods Used
*Mathematical Analysis Software* <br>
Matlab - I used Matlab to create plots of the spectra of the magnetic flux Schrodinger operators acting on the fundamental domains of various materials that I studied. These plots were used to detect potential touching points and estimate their location. <br>
Maple - I used Maple to determine the precise location of touching points before formally proving them by hand. 

*Methods Used* <br>
I verify the existence of Dirac conical points by modeling a material as a 2 dimensional infinite periodic graph, the spectrum of which can be found using Floquet-Bloch theory. I find the fundamental domain of this graph, find its magnetic flux Schrodinger operator, and take the union over all possible values of magnetic flux. I then calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors at the possible touching points to show that there exist linearly independent eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue.
